# VR_Class

 Students will learn the basics of game development and Virtual Reality by creating a game! This course will cover topics such as game engines, 3D space, art assets, and an introduction to coding. We will bring it all together to create a game in virtual reality. No programming experience is necessary but participants need a general familiarity with computers and using software.

# Cirriculum

## Session 1: Overview
VR Safety, Intro To Unity (Position, Rotation Scale), Build A Snowman

### VR Safety

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ke4MefpmRmc&ab_channel=MetaQuest

If any student feels dizzy
- Take off the headset
- Take a seat
- Grab a water and or snack

Teacher notes
- Ensure snacks and water are readily available
- Keep an eye out for off balance students
- Know where the nursing program is in case medical attention is required

#### Creating A Safe Stationary Boundry

No Room Scale boundaries are allowed in this class.

*Excercise: Practice setting up a new boundary*

Have the students:
- Disconnect the Link Cable from the headset
- Put on the wrist straps and headset 'welder style' resting on their forehead
- Walk across the room, outside their previously set up boundary
- Set up a stationary boundary
- Walk back to their original station, 
- Ensure each student is at least arms reach away from
- - Their desk
- - Other students. This may require stagering their chair positons for safe distance
- Set up another stationary boundary near their station

Purpose: Help the students get comfortable with this process of setting up a safe boundary


#### Coiling Cords

A simple circle coil with enough space on either end to reach the computer and headset, velcroing the circle closed. This is covered in the first 30 seconds of this video:

### Intro To Unity

Have the students open the NUAC_VR_Class Project in Unity. The layout used in this class is 2 by 3.

#### Position, Rotation, Scale

#### Build a Snowman

Using position, rotation, and scale, make 3 spheres on top of each other. The smallest on top, the largest on the bottom.

Extra Challenges:
- Add a Hat
- Add a face
- Add color: https://youtube.com/shorts/mJ2y-eNDTxY?si=_dYi70ktqydniQac

## Session 2: Living Room 1: Build a Living Room
Using Unity's Create With VR project, we are going to design a living room.

Starting with Assets/Scenes/Create-with-VR-Startr-Scene.unity, have the student open the scene and save it with their name:

example: LivingRoom_JohnDoe.unity

You can use the following lesson plan segments from Create With VR:
1.2 - Explore the StarterScene
1.3 - Add a room and backaground
https://learn.unity.com/tutorial/vr-project-setup?uv=2022.3&courseId=60183276edbc2a2e6c4c7dae&projectId=60183335edbc2a2e6c4c7dcb#65c511fbedbc2a263ed98726

Once the room is in, hide the floor plane by disabling its renderer so it does not clip into the room floor.

Have the students furnish the living room with prefabs in Assets/_Course Library/_Prefabs

## Session 3: Living Room 2: Import Assets Into The Living Room
Student's continue to build our their living rooms. They now download assets form the Unity Asset Store* and import them into the project.

## Session 5: Coding
Students will review two scripts and write thier own. The result is a button that makes an explosion. Please review this video prio to the class:

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WWv2AALDEw

The code can be found in Readme_files folder
- ExplodeScript.pdf: meant to be printed prior to class. One per student
- OnTriggerExplode.txt: meant to be copied and pasted for the teacher.

## Session 6: Block Slicer 1: Import A Song
Students will be introduced to Block Slicer project. They can choose a song on youtube*, convert it to mp3, and import it into the project.

Block Slicer Overview, Script Description, Import A Song, Level Design:

## Session 7: Block Slicer 2: Import Assets
Students continue the Block Slicer project, adding assets into the game to fit their theme.

https://youtu.be/q5ejxITvEh8?si=KGsG8_Xfnx2bWijT

## Session 8: Block Slicer Finale: Shocase
The first half of the project is wrapping up the game. The second half is testing and providing feedback to each other's games.

I suggest providing each station with a notepad and pencil for constructive feedback.

Often students have asked 'What now?'. To help answer this question, I created this doc: https://docs.google.com/document/d/1-Zr1-BWbv38F5prGsQcs3Cpi0dr8enqO48IX3qsXLcw/edit?usp=sharing

I encourage the teacher to review this document with the class then copy the content to an email and send it to any student tht is interested.


*Any and all contant that is imported into our projects will be 'class appropriate / PG'. If a student is unsure if content is fits that category, teacher is encouraged to make a judgement call.
